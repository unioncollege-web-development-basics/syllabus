## Week 2 - Big Concepts In Web Development

"Just because we grew up with the Internet doesn’t mean the Internet is grown up." —Sherry Turkle.

You, my dear web development students, are future makers of Internet things. You are learning the tools and techniques to build things that will live on the Internet and the World Wide Web.

In Chapter 3—Some Big Concepts You Need to Know—we look a bit more at the recent history of web development and attempt to peer into the future. We explore concepts such as 
**web standards**,
**progressive enhancement**,
**future friendly**,
**responsive web design**,
**accessibility**, and
**performance**. 

These concepts frame our process of web development and allow us to create robust, accessible, performant web pages and sites that will live long into the future. If we are successful, they may even outlive us.
