## Learning Strategies

### Quizzes and Exercises
The textbook—Learning Web Design—is a crucial, non-optional component of this class. It contains a majority of the content that we will be covering and provides an outline for many of the assigned exercises.

Quizzes and exercises will be used to assess your understanding of the material and to provide an opportunity for feedback and clarification of key ideas. They also constitute a large portion of your grade. Quizzes and exercises must be submitted on Moodle before class time on the day they are due.
Attendance and Class Participation

The in-class lectures and presentations are intended to highlight key concepts, clarify challenging areas, and expand on select subjects and ideas. We will not cover everything in class, so please read and study the assigned readings. Please be prompt, present and fully engaged during our class time—I will do my best to be so also. Attendance will be taken each class period, as attendance and class participation constitutes a large portion of your grade.

### Final Project
The final project in this class will involve setting up and styling a complete website with multiple pages. It is intended to be a challenging project requiring a comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS.

### Final Exam

The final examination will be on Wednesday, May 7 at 6:30p. It will be an evaluation of your understanding of how to use HTML and CSS to solve several common use- cases. An examination study guide will be provided.

### Emergencies
I am willing to work out other arrangements with you if you have an unexpected crisis. Please let me know as soon as possible, and we will work to find a reasonable solution.

### Grade Reevaluation
Please let me know if you feel that the grade you receive is not correct. A formal "Request for Reevaluation form" is available on request.

The schedule, syllabus, homework, or grade breakdown may be adjusted as needed to meet the stated goals and objectives in the limited time available. Changes will be discussed in class and announced via email.

### Computer Accounts
You are required to have working Union College computer accounts for email and Moodle, and to check them periodically for updates or announcements.

You are required to follow all rules for all computer labs you have access to in the Union College computer network. Class deadlines will not be extended for students who have account problems due to their negligence or have had their accounts suspended or restricted due to computer violations.

### Attendance Policy
Every student is expected to attend every scheduled class, be on time, come to class prepared, and participate in class activities. You are responsible for obtaining materials given in class. If you are more than 15 minutes late for a class it will be counted as an absence. What constitutes an excused absence is the prerogative of the instructor, not the student.

### Plagiarism Policy
Plagiarism occurs whenever one “steals” or “uses” the ideas or writings (or answers or program code, etc) of another without attribution. Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this class. The first offense will result in a zero for the graded item for all students involved. The second offense will result in an “F” for the course. Per Union College’s policy, plagiarism will be reported to the division chair and Vice President for Academic Administration.

Unless stated otherwise in writing, all work in this class is to be completed by you (i.e., individual work). You may ask questions of each other on assignments, but you must complete the assignments on your own.
